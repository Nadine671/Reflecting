# Reflecting
\\\Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I choosd to submit the project from week 7. The reason I picked this project to upload is because it is the one I struggled the most with. I tried to get the data to output the number of times an item was in the list of grocery items but I couldn't get my code to execute the way it was supposed to. 
\\\What did you do particularly well?
I think I created the classes well. 
\\\Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think where I could enhance my code would be with making sure that I uploaded the files properly to Visual Studios so it could execute properly. 
\\\Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did have a hard with with the class itself but using the recommened resources gave me the refreser I needed to be able to complete my project to the best of my abilities.
\\\What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
In general, knowing the basics to C++ would potentially help me a lot in the future and even for creating a resume. 
\\\How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I had to keep refering back to my resources through Zybooks to be able to write the code properly. Rereading and even watching some YouTube videos on how to perform certin actions helped me a lot.
